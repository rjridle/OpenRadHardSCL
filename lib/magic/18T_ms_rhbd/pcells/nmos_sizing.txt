# Different methods for sizing annular nmos transistors

## Annular Enclosed Layout Transistor
Following is different methods of calculating the W/L in annular ELT's

### Mid-Line Approximation:

    Take length L to be the distance between source and drain, which in this
    case is just the minimum feature size.

        L = 0.15um

    The width is the sum of all the lines going through the midpoint of the
    circular portion of the nmos:

        W = 2*ml1 + 2*ml2 + 4*ml_hypotenuse

          = 2(0.22) + 2(0.34) + 4*sqrt(0.155^2 + 0.155^2)
          = 1.9968124um
    
    The W/L given by calibre after extracting the GDS is

        L = 0.163375um
        W = 2.30604um

## Rectangular Enclosed Layout Transistor
Following is different methods of calculating the W/L in rectangular ELT's.

### Mid-line Approximation

    W/L given by calibre after extraction is
