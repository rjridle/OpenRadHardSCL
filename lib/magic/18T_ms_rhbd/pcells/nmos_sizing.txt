# Different methods for sizing annular nmos transistors

## Annular Enclosed Layout Transistor
Following is different methods of calculating the W/L in annular ELT's

## Mid-Line Approximation:

 * Mid-Line Approx. done by hand
    W = 2*(0.22) + 2*(0.34) + 4*sqrt(0.155^2 + 0.155^2)
      = 1.997u
    L = 0.150u (L is taken to be the min distance between src and drain)
    
 * Magic extraction
    W = 3.000u
    L = 0.150u

 * Calibre extraction
    W = 2.306u
    L = 0.163u

## Rectangular Enclosed Layout Transistor
Following is different methods of calculating the W/L in rectangular ELT's.

 * Mid-Line Approx. done by hand. 
    W = 2*(0.65) + 2*(0.52)
      = 2.340u
    L = 0.150u (L is taken to be the min distance between src and drain)

 * Magic extraction
    W = 2.285u
    L = 0.150u

 * Calibre extraction
    W = 2.555u
    L = 0.154u
